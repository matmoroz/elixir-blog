I'm a Product Manager in Bosch Poland responsible for a proper running of a TeamCenter Product Cost Management a tool used by a Bosch engineers all over the world. On my duty is to ensure the continuous operation of the database and improvement of the extensions or tools. During my work I'm often programming macros in Excel using a language Visual Basics of Application and cooperating with a database, using T-SQL in MS SQL Studio. In my opinion those language aren't so efficient and I'm thinking about more modern way of my programming knowledge progress. Because of that I've decided to learn other programming languages which will open more paths in my job carreer. Nowadays programming is a precious topic on the job market, not only because of the really high salary, but also really interesting and dynamic way of work.

My close friend - Karol Moroz who is a software developer (link to his blog https://moroz.dev) gave me an "Iron Man" challange. It's an efficient way of new programming language education, where I have to start a blog about learning progress, where I have to show everyday what new I've learned. I have to say, I had no experience in running a website I had to learn everything from the begginning, to understand how it works and what everything means.

So at 21st of May 2022 I asked Karol Moroz to help me to start running a blog. He picked me up with his Audi A3 IV (8Y) and we got together to Biedronka Supermarket to buy some "Kaszanka" and alcohol-free lager beer, for a better start. With his help I've started a blog based on a blog open-source template from git-hub (https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). Since that day I'm a Linux user who tries to understand more about software developing. Anything new for me will be described in a further posts.
