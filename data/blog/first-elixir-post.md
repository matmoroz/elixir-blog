# Introduction
Nowadays programming is a precious topic on the job market, not only because of the really high salary, but also really interesting and dynamic way of work. The most valuable valuable languages on the job-market are those which are evolving and are more efficient in every year of usage. Because of that I've decided to learn other programming languages which will open more paths in my job carreer.

Before I had no experience in running a website, so I had to learn everything from the begginning, to understand how it works.

So at 21st of May 2022 I asked Karol Moroz to help me to start running a blog. He picked me up with his Audi A3 IV (8Y) and we get together to Biedronka Supermarket to buy some "Kaszanka" and alcohol-free lager beer, for a better start. With his help I've started a blog based on a blog open-source template from git-hub (https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). Since that day I'm a Linux user who tries to understand more about software developing. Take in mind that I'm not an expert, so if you'll find any mistake in my blog - let me know. Any help would be appreciated.

# Basic knowledge
**Node.js**<br/>
---to be described---<br/>

**JavaScript**<br/>
---to be described---

**Package manager**<br/>
It's a system or set of tools used to automate installing, upgrading, configuring and using software. Useful during cooperation with a Node.js.<br/>
`npm` - a tool used to install packages with .<br/>
`npx` - a tool used to execute packages with NPM package manager.<br/>

You can use the following command to install `npm` on your PC.
```shell
npm install
```
`yarn` - a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js

**GitHub**<br/>
It's a web service for software developers to store and watch all the changes which were done in one repository. In other words it's a place where a programmer can store files of his project and also see all his changes, which makes it easier to go back to the previous state if a mistake was done. It's can be really useful. When a program works, but after a change doesn't, it's much easier to locate a bug and fix it, when a changes are highlightend and aren't to big. Before any further work it's necessary to connect your PC to you GitHub account with an SSH key generated on your PC.

# Start of a blog
The first step was to copy a github repo of a blog localy package manager and `degit` command.
```shell
npx degit https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.git
```
You've just downloaded this .git to ~/.degit/github/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog
